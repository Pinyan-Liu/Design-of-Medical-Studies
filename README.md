This includes the proposal of the clinical trial.

SCHEMA
 
Purpose
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a virtual reality (VR) intervention in the reduction of incidence of chronic pain post-orthopedic surgery. The secondary outcome is to evaluate potential depression, anxiety, and opioid use in patients during a 6 month recovery period.
 
Design
This study is a phase 2 placebo-controlled randomized trial to evaluate a VR intervention in a post-operative orthopedic surgery setting. Participants will be recruited from the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) orthopedic surgery department if they are scheduled to have elective orthopedic surgery or from the emergency or trauma departments if they are identified as needing emergent orthopedic surgery and randomized to either the VR intervention or control arm. Biosamples and questionnaires will be used to measure pain levels from the time of surgery to six months post-operative in order to assess any changes in pain conversion from acute to chronic pain, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and opioid use patterns.
 
Study Population
Patients with elective or emergent orthopedic surgery presenting at the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). 
 
Study Size
A total of 100 participants may be recruited to yield a total of 80 evaluable participants- 40 participants per study arm.
 
Treatment Regimen
Participants randomized to the study intervention will receive a VR intervention and placebo participants will receive a web-based health and wellness TV channel.
 
Study Duration
Study participation will last approximately 6 months per participant, beginning from the day of their orthopedic surgery and the study will aim to be completed in 3 years.
 
Primary Objective:
路 To determine if the use of a VR intervention reduces the conversion of acute to chronic pain after orthopedic surgery as measured by an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) of pain intensity from PROMIS pain measures
 
Secondary Objectives:
路 To measure changes in pain-linked biomarker expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A and V member 1 (TRPV1 and TRPA1) and metabolites in the kynurenic acid pathway to assess neurogenic inflammation in post-operative pain patients

路 To measure changes in depression and anxiety as short-term (7 days) and long-term (6 month) outcomes of orthopedic surgery using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale as well as TRPV1 and TRPA1 expression levels

路 To study short-term (7 days) and long-term (6 months) changes in opioid usage patterns in post-orthopedic surgery patients using morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and self-reported outcomes
